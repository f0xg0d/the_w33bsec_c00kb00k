Inspect page -> password inside a comment in the body

## Natas Level 0 → Level 1

Page says right clicking has been blocked - However the block is done in correctly and does not apply to the whole page. Even if it was CTRL + SHIFT + I (Firefox) would bypass this block\
Once the inspector is open the password can once again be found inside a comment

## Natas Level 1 → Level 2

```
Username: natas2
Password: TguMNxKo1DSa1tujBLuZJnDUlCcUAPlI
